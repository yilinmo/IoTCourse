#+DESCRIPTION: Howto for the creation of OER presentations (HTML with audio) with reveal.js from Org mode sources

* Presentation Hints
** General
   - This is a [[https://revealjs.com][reveal.js]] presentation and an
     [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources][Open Educational Resource (OER)]]
     - Generated with [[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal][emacs-reveal]]
       from [[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal-howto][Free/libre Org mode sources]]
       - See [[https://oer.gitlab.io/hints.html][usage hints for emacs-reveal presentations]]
       - Emacs-reveal 8.0.0 supports reveal.js 4
     - Key bindings and navigation
       - Press “?” to see key bindings of reveal.js
         - In general, “n” and “p” move to next and previous slide; mouse
	   wheel works as well
         - Search with Ctrl-Shift-F
       - Up/down (swiping, arrows) move within sections,
         left/right jump between sections (type “o” to see what is where)
       - Type slide’s number followed by Enter to jump to that slide
       - Browser history (buttons, Alt-CursorLeft, Alt-CursorRight)
       - Zoom with Ctrl-Mouse or Alt-Mouse

** Why?
   - I created emacs-reveal as software bundle to produce
     [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources][Open Educational Resources (OER)]]
     for my own teaching
     - Described in cite:Lec19a
     - Personally, I prefer text over video when learning
       - Skim reading with superior search, navigation, and
         hyperlinks; own speed
       - Lots of students like audio explanations (and PDF), though
   - Education should be free and open
     - [[https://electures.uni-muenster.de/engage/theodul/ui/core.html?id=bfd84252-634d-40d0-996a-3979a21abe3e][Recording of a talk “Open Educational Resources: What, why, and how?”]]
     - Proper license attribution is a hassle
       - Emacs-reveal simplifies that process (for me), see cite:Lec19b

** Offline work
   - Students often ask for download-able presentations
   - Alternatives
     1. Clone repository, build presentations locally (see [[#usage][Usage]])
     2. Download build artifacts from
        [[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal-howto/pipelines][recent pipeline]]
        (if not expired)
     3. Generate PDF
        - Why, really?
	  - Why not download source files instead?
	  - [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]], which is plain text
	- Change the URL by adding “?print-pdf” after “.html”,
	  then print to PDF file (usually, Ctrl-p)
	- Alternatively, generate PDF via LaTeX from Org
	  source file
          - Replace ~.html~ (and whatever follows) in address bar of
            browser with ~.pdf~

** Audio
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_extra_attr: data-audio-src="./audio/Tours_-_01_-_Enthusiast.ogg"
   :END:
   - Audio should start automatically here (differently from emacs-reveal’s default)
     - Enthusiast by
       [[https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Tours/][Tours]]
       - Licensed under
  	 [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/][Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)]]
       - Converted to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg][free Ogg format]] with [[https://www.audacityteam.org/][Audacity]]
     - See [[https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/tree/master/audio-slideshow#user-content-compatibility-and-known-issues][compatibility and known issues of the underlying audio plugin]]
       - [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/][Firefox]],
         which I recommend as browser in general
         ([[https://blogs.fsfe.org/jens.lechtenboerger/2015/06/09/three-steps-towards-more-privacy-on-the-net/][here in English]]
         and [[https://www.informationelle-selbstbestimmung-im-internet.de/][here in German]]),
         seems to work everywhere
     - Audio controls are shown at bottom left

** (Speaker) Notes
   # The simplest form of macro reveallicense() occurs on
   # [[#what][a slide below]].  On this slide and below, it shows an
   # inline image with vertically aligned, rotated license statement.
   # Here, the fourth argument is t, which indicates that shortened
   # license information should be displayed.  This is particularly useful
   # for CC0 (Public Domain) work, which does not require attribution
   # but where others might still want to know that it can be reused
   # under less restrictive conditions than the overall work.
   - Slides contain additional notes as plain text if you see the
     folder icon at the top right (as on this slide)
     {{{reveallicense("./figures/icons/folder_inbox.meta","10vh",nil,t)}}}
     - Either press “v” to see the “courseware view”
       or click on that icon or press “s” to see the “speaker notes view”
     - You need to allow pop-ups
       - If the pop-up window does not work, you may need to press “s”
         twice or close the pop-up window once
#+BEGIN_NOTES
These are sample notes
- Lists can be used here
- You can time your presentation
  - Maybe look at [[https://gitlab.com/lechten/talks-2018/blob/master/2018-04-24-Blockchain.org][one]] of my talks to see how to define timing
#+END_NOTES

* Introduction

** What’s This?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: what
   :END:
   # Note the use of macro reveallicense() below to show an inline image
   # with vertically aligned, rotated license statement.
   # Alternatively, one could also use standard Org mode features and
   # replace the macro with a #+CAPTION, which would be displayed
   # underneath the image.
   # Again alternatively, later as part of slide figure-with-meta-data,
   # you can see the use of macro revealimg(), to display a
   # horizontally centered image with caption and license statement.
   # The immediately following slide describes the required format of
   # meta-data.
   # Both macros are defined in config.org of oer-reveal.
   - ~Emacs-reveal~ is [[https://fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware.en.html][free software]]
     to generate [[https://revealjs.com/][reveal.js]] presentations (slides with audio) from simple text
     files in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]]
     {{{reveallicense("./figures/3d-man/board.meta","30vh")}}}
     - Benefits
       - For your audience
         - Self-contained presentations embedding audio
         - Usable on lots of (including mobile and offline) devices with
           just a browser
       - For you as producer
         - Separation of layout and contents
	   (similarly to, e.g., LaTeX)
         - Simple text format allows diff and merge for ease of collaboration

** Prerequisites
  - I suppose (and strongly recommend) that you use GNU/Linux
    ([[https://getgnulinux.org/switch_to_linux/try_or_install/][help on getting started]])
    - Actually, not much here is operating system specific
  - ~Emacs-reveal~ should really be used with the text editor [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]
    - (You could try other editors and build presentations within
      GitLab, thanks to GitLab’s infrastructure)
      - (In fact, you do not need an editor at all but could edit
        presentations using a Web browser on ~GitLab.com~, e.g., with the
        [[https://gitlab.com/-/ide/project/oer/emacs-reveal-howto/edit/master/][Web IDE]]
        (requires login))

** Installation and Quickstart
   - ~Emacs-reveal~ builds upon Gnu Emacs with
     [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]]
     - [[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal][~Emacs-reveal~ is
       available as free software on GitLab]]
   - You also need Git
     - [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git][Getting started]]
       - The [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2][Pro Git book]] is a great source in general
     - [[https://oer.gitlab.io/oer-courses/cacs/Git-Introduction.html][Git introduction as OER]]
       (created with ~emacs-reveal~)

*** Initial Consideration
    - ~Emacs-reveal~ can manage bundled software
      - (Submodules for Lisp
        packages Org mode, org-re-reveal, org-re-reveal-ref, oer-reveal
        as well as reveal.js with several plugins)
      - Default with customizable variable
        ~emacs-reveal-managed-install-p~ being ~t~
      - Variable ~oer-reveal-revealjs-version~ specifies the
        target version of reveal.js for emacs-reveal
    - Or, you manage those components yourself
      - Set ~emacs-reveal-managed-install-p~ to ~nil~
    - In any case, ~emacs-reveal~ changes values of other packages
      (~org-ref~, ~oer-reveal~) without warning

*** Managed install of ~emacs-reveal~
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: git-install
    :END:
    - Install ~emacs-reveal~ in a directory of your choice
      1. Choose directory, e.g., =~/.emacs.d/elpa=, and clone software
         - =cd ~/.emacs.d/elpa=
         - ~git clone --recursive https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal.git~
           - (Option ~--recursive~ downloads submodules)
      2. Add following lines to =~/.emacs=
         - =(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/elpa/emacs-reveal")=
         - =(require 'emacs-reveal)=
      3. Restart Emacs (installation of ~org-ref~ is offered, if necessary)

*** Alternative installation
    - You may prefer to manage submodules of ~emacs-reveal~
      yourself
      1. Choose directory and clone (without option ~--recursive~)
         - =cd ~/.emacs.d/elpa=
         - ~git clone https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal.git~
      2. Add following lines to =~/.emacs=
         - =(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/elpa/emacs-reveal")=
         - =(setq emacs-reveal-managed-install-p nil)=
           - Read doc string of ~emacs-reveal-managed-install-p~
         - =(require 'emacs-reveal)=
      3. (Now, subdirectories under ="~/.emacs.d/elpa/emacs-reveal"=
         remain empty)

*** Quickstart with ~emacs-reveal~
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: git-howto
    :END:
    - E.g., generate this howto
      1. Install emacs-reveal (see previous two slides for alternatives)
      2. Choose directory for howto, clone it
         - ~git clone --recursive https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal-howto.git~
           - Option ~--recursive~ gets an embedded repository for figures
         - ~cd emacs-reveal-howto/~
      3. Generate the HTML presentation from Org source ~howto.org~
         - ~emacs --batch --load elisp/publish.el~
         - Publication code needs to be able to locate ~emacs-reveal.el~
           - Code in ~elisp/publish.el~ tries
             (a) =~/.emacs.d/elpa/emacs-reveal= (suggested on
             [[#git-install][earlier slide]]) and
             (b) sibling directory ~emacs-reveal~

* Usage
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: usage
  :END:

** Alternatives
   1. Create presentations locally on Command Line
   2. Create presentations in GNU Emacs
   3. Create presentations with [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]]
      {{{reveallicense("./figures/logos/docker-horizontal.meta","10vh")}}}
      - [[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal/container_registry][Docker image emacs-reveal]]
        - Similarly to previous alternative; necessary software bundled
        - See [[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal/blob/master/README.md][README of emacs-reveal]]
        - [[https://oer.gitlab.io/oer-courses/vm-neuland/04-Docker.html][Introduction to Docker]],
          built with ~emacs-reveal~
   4. Create and publish presentations on [[https://about.gitlab.com/][GitLab]]
      {{{reveallicense("./figures/logos/GitLab-wm_no_bg.meta","10vh")}}}
      - Based on [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/][GitLab Continuous Integration infrastructure]]
        and above Docker image

** Build Presentations on Command Line
   0. [@0] Install [[#git-install][emacs-reveal]] and [[#git-howto][howto]]
   1. Create Org file in directory ~emacs-reveal-howto~
      - See contained source file for this presentation, ~howto.org~
   2. Build presentations for files ending in ~.org~
      - (Except internal ones, see function ~oer-reveal-publish-all~)
      - ~emacs --batch --load elisp/publish.el~
        - Presentations are built in subdirectory ~public/~
   3. Open presentation in [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/][Firefox]]
      - E.g.: ~firefox public/howto.html~
   4. Optional: Copy ~public/~ to public web server

** Building Presentations in Emacs
   1. Generate HTML presentation for visited
      ~.org~ file using Org export functionality: @@html:<br>@@
      Press ~C-c C-e w b~ (export with oer-reveal)
      - This generates HTML file in current directory and opens it
	in default browser
      - For this to work
        1. Settings of ~emacs-reveal~ should be in effect
           (~emacs-reveal.el~ is loaded, e.g., with
           [[#git-install][step (2) above]])
        2. Necessary resources, in particular
	  ~reveal.js~, must be accessible in ~.org~ file’s
	  directory
           - I use
             ~emacs --batch --load elisp/publish.el~
             once to populate ~public/~, then create a symbolic link:

             ~ln -s public/reveal.js~
        3. For image grids, you may need:
           ~(setq oer-reveal-export-dir "./")~

*** Org-re-reveal and oer-reveal
    - Emacs-reveal embeds the packages org-re-reveal and oer-reveal
      - Package oer-reveal is an Org mode export backend (extending
        org-re-reveal)
        - Starting with oer-reveal 1.4.0, part of emacs-reveal 4.1.0
        - With key binding mentioned on previous slide
      - You can export with org-re-reveal (~C-c C-e v v~ and ~C-c C-e
        v b~) or oer-reveal (~C-c C-e w w~ and ~C-c C-e w b~)
        - With oer-reveal, additional reveal.js plugins are enabled by
          default
          - See customizable variables ~oer-reveal-plugins~ and
            ~oer-reveal-plugin-config~

** Build Presentations on GitLab
   1. Fork [[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal-howto][emacs-reveal-howto]]
      on GitLab ([[https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/workflow/forking_workflow.html][fork documentation]])
      - ~git clone <the URL of YOUR GitLab project>~
   2. Create or update Org files in cloned directory
      - Push changes to your fork
   3. GitLab infrastructure picks up changes and publishes presentations as
      [[https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/][GitLab Pages]]
      - Based on Continuous Integration (CI) infrastructure
        - Configured by file
          [[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal-howto/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml][.gitlab-ci.yml]]
      - CI run takes some minutes
      - Go to Settings → Pages to see the Pages’ address

* Some Presentation Features
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: features
  :END:

** Text Slide
   - A list
   - With a sub-list whose items appear
     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
     - This is /emphasized/
     - This is *bold*
     - This ~looks like code~
     - This is [[color:green][green]]
     - Nothing special

** Some Fragment Styles
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (gray-out shrink grow highlight-red)
   - Forget
   - Shrink
   - Grow
   - Very important

*** Fragments with Custom Order
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) :frag_idx (1 4 3 2 1)
    * I’m first.
    * Fourth.
    * Third.
    * Second.
    * I’m also first.

** Centered Text

   #+ATTR_HTML: :class org-center
   Just some horizontally centered text.  Created by assigning a class
   with ~text-align: center~.

** On Sections
   # As explained in the Org manual, link targets can have different
   # forms.  The first link below points to #features, which has been
   # defined above as CUSTOM_ID.  The second link uses the section
   # header’s text as link target.
   - This slide is part of section [[#features][Some Presentation Features]]
     - We can link to slides, e.g., [[Text Slide][an earlier slide]]
       - You can use the browser history to go back
     - Side note: Check source code to see two variants of link
       targets used on this slide
   # The following directive with “appear” lets the next thing
   # appear in its entirety; instead of each list item individually as
   # on the previous slide with “(appear)” in parentheses.
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
   - This slide can also be perceived as its own subsection
     - The [[#another-anchor][next slide]] is on a deeper level of nesting
   - (This list item appears simultaneously with previous bullet point)

*** Another Slide
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: another-anchor
    :END:
    - This slide is on a deeper level of nesting
    - This level of nesting is not shown in the table of contents in
      the slide’s bottom
    - By the way, the headings in the table of contents below are
      hyperlinks
      - And your browser remembers the history, back/forward buttons
        and shortcuts should work
      - Mousewheel and swiping work

** Licensing
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: licensing
   :END:
   - Starting with emacs-reveal 5.0.3 (and oer-reveal 2.0.2),
     presentations can show license information derived from
     SPDX headers of the [[https://reuse.software/][REUSE]] project
     - See [[#license][licensing slide]] at the end of this presentation
       - Information on that slide is derived from
         header lines of ~howto.org~

         #+END_SRC
       - Note that SPDX headers must be prefixed with ~#+~ to
         be recognized as Org mode keywords
     - License information is also embedded in machine-readable RDFa
       format
   - Macros for OER figures with (human- and machine-readable)
     license information are discussed [[#figure-with-meta-data][later]]

** Two Columns: Pro/Con of emacs-reveal
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
   #+BEGIN_leftcol
   Pro
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Free/libre open source software
   - Device-independent presentations
     - Also mobile and offline
     - Generated from simple text format
       - Easy to learn
       - Collaboration with diff/merge/git
       - Separation of layout and content
   #+END_leftcol

* Figures and Audio

** Slide with Figure and Audio
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_extra_attr: data-audio-src="./audio/Tours_-_01_-_Enthusiast.ogg"
   :END:
   - This figure is part of a
     [[https://oer.gitlab.io/OS/Operating-Systems-Memory-II.html][different presentation]]
     {{{reveallicense("./figures/OS/clock-steps.meta","40vh",nil,'none)}}}
     - Notice: No license displayed for figure → License of document applies
   - The song Enthusiast by
     [[https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Tours/][Tours]]
     is licensed under
     [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/][Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)]]


** Figure with Caption and License
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: figure-with-meta-data
   :END:
   - Display image with meta-data specified in file
     - Simplify sharing of images with source and license
   - Functionality and meta-data format are specific
     to ~emacs-reveal~
     - See next slide for sample file

   {{{revealimg("./figures/3d-man/decision.meta","To share or not to share","30vh")}}}

*** Meta-Data File for Previous Image
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sample-figure-meta-data
    :END:

#+INCLUDE: "./figures/3d-man/decision.meta" src emacs-lisp

** An Image Grid: Computers

{{{revealgrid(42,"./figures/devices/computer.grid",60,4,3,"\"ga1 ga2 ga2 ga3\" \"ga1 ga4 ga5 ga6\" \"ga7 ga8 ga9 ga9\"")}}}

*** Creation of Previous Image Grid
    - Single line in source file, using macro ~revealgrid~
      #+ATTR_REVEAL: :htmlize t
      #+BEGIN_SRC
{{{revealgrid(42,"./figures/devices/computer.grid",60,4,3,"\"ga1 ga2 ga2 ga3\" \"ga1 ga4 ga5 ga6\" \"ga7 ga8 ga9 ga9\"")}}}
      #+END_SRC
      - Arguments explained in
        [[https://gitlab.com/oer/oer-reveal/blob/master/org/config.org][config.org of oer-reveal]]
      - With file ~computer.grid~ as follows
        #+INCLUDE: "./figures/devices/computer.grid" src emacs-lisp

*** Notes on figures
    - If you used emacs-reveal previously and did not like that it
      exported all figures from a growing repository, note
      that as of emacs-reveal 5.2.0, only used figures are exported
    - So far, emacs-reveal uses meta-data in an ad-hoc format (as
      shown on a [[#sample-figure-meta-data][previous slide]])
      - For all [[https://gitlab.com/oer/figures/][figures in this repository]]
      - Please, contact me if you’d like to contribute with a
        different format, e.g., JSON-LD
        - Maybe with an [[https://gitlab.com/oer/figures/issues][issue]]?

** Quiz Plugin
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: quiz-support
   :END:
   - ~Emacs-reveal~ embeds this
     [[https://gitlab.com/schaepermeier/reveal.js-quiz][quiz plugin]]
     - [[https://schaepermeier.gitlab.io/reveal-quiz-demo/demo.html][Demo of plugin’s author]]
   - In presentations, quizzes support active learning
     - In particular, retrieval practice

*** Sample Quiz
#+REVEAL_HTML: <script data-quiz src="./quizzes/sample-quiz.js"></script>

#+MACRO: klipse-languages (eval (message "%s" (mapconcat #'identity org-re-reveal-klipse-languages ", ")))
** Klipse for Code Evaluation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: klipse-support
   :END:
   - Org-re-reveal supports [[https://github.com/viebel/klipse][Klipse]]
     - Teach programming
       - Code changes in upper part result in output changes in lower part
     - Browser-side code evaluation for various programming languages
       - See ~org-re-reveal-klipse-languages~ for supported subset
         - {{{klipse-languages}}}
       - To activate, either add option ~reveal_klipsify_src:t~ (as in
         header of this file) or set variable ~org-re-reveal-klipsify-src~
         to ~t~; be sure to disable scaling of reveal.js
       - Correct indentation may require that you set
         ~org-src-preserve-indentation~ to ~t~ (see bottom of this file)
   - Code on next two slides copied from
     [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/blob/master/Readme.org][README of Org-Reveal]]

*** HTML Src Block
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<h1 class="whatever">hello, what's your name</h1>
#+END_SRC

*** Javascript Src Block
#+BEGIN_SRC js
console.log("success");
var x='string using single quote';
x
#+END_SRC

*** PHP Src Block
#+BEGIN_SRC php
$name = "Alice";
echo "Moin " . $name . "!";
#+END_SRC

*** Python Src Block
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(10))
#+END_SRC

** Figures with Babel
   - Org export can execute embedded source code, with results
     injected into exported HTML presentation
     - For example, [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-dot.html][diagrams generated with ~dot~ of Graphviz]]
   - With emacs-reveal
     - Activate necessary source languages in ~oer-reveal-publish-babel-languages~
     - Maybe generate figures into separate directory
       - Publish contents with ~org-publish-project-alist~
   - See subsequent slides for sample code

*** Hello World with Dot
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :htmlize t
#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file img/hello-world.png :exports both
graph {
  hello [label="Hello"];
  world [label="World!"];

  hello -- world;
  }
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:img/hello-world.png]]

*** Relevant Excerpt of Publication Code
    - The following snippet of ~elisp/publish.el~ activates ~dot~ and
      publication of generated images
      - Adapt based on your needs
        - Note that necessary directories must exist (Babel does not
          create them)
      #+ATTR_REVEAL: :htmlize t
      #+begin_src elisp
(make-directory "img" t)
(setq oer-reveal-publish-babel-languages '((dot . t) (emacs-lisp . t))
      org-publish-project-alist
      (list (list "img"
                  :base-directory "img"
                  :base-extension "png"
                  :publishing-function 'org-publish-attachment
                  :publishing-directory "./public/img")))
      #+end_src

** Need Additional Software in Publication Process?
   - Maybe suggest as [[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal/-/issues][issue for Docker image of emacs-reveal]]
   - Or install additional software in Docker container of your project with [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/][~before_script~]]
