#+TITLE: How to create presentations with emacs-reveal
#+SUBTITLE: (Press ~?~ for help, ~n~ and ~p~ for next and previous slide)
#+AUTHOR: Jens Lechtenbörger
#+DATE: November 2017


* Introduction
** What’s This?
   # Note the use of macro imglicense() below to show an image with
   # vertically aligned, rotated license statement.
   # Alternatively, one could also use standard org mode features and
   # replace the macro with a #+CAPTION, which would be displayed
   # underneath the image.
   # Towards the end of this file, you can see the use of a second
   # macro, imgwithcap(), to display an image with caption and license
   # statement.
   # Both macros are defined in emacs-reveal/config.org, where also a
   # brief explanation is available.
   - Emacs-reveal is [[https://fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware.en.html][free software]]
     to generate [[http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/][reveal.js]] presentations (slides with audio) from simple text
     files in [[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]]

   - Benefits
     - For your audience
       - Self-contained presentations embedding audio
       - Usable on lots of (including mobile and offline) devices with
         just a browser
     - For you as producer
       - Separation of layout and contents
	 - Similarly to, e.g., LaTeX
       - Simple text format allows diff and merge for ease of collaboration

** Prerequisites
  - I suppose that you use GNU/Linux
    ([[https://getgnulinux.org/switch_to_linux/try_or_install/][help on getting started]])
    - Actually, not much here is operating system specific
  - This software should really be used with the text editor [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]
    - (You could try other editors and build presentations on GitLab’s
      infrastructure)

** Installation
   1. Download software
      - Install emacs-reveal-howto
	- ~git clone https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal-howto.git~
	- ~cd emacs-reveal-howto/~
      - Install submodules
	- ~git submodule sync --recursive~
	- ~git submodule update --init --recursive~
   2. Install and configure Emacs packages
      - ~emacs --batch --load emacs-reveal/install.el --funcall install~
      - Add a line like this to =~/.emacs=
	- =(load "/path/to/emacs-reveal/reveal-config.el")=


* Usage
** Alternatives
   1. Create presentations locally on Command Line
   2. Create presentations in Emacs
   3. Create and publish presentations on [[https://about.gitlab.com/][GitLab]]
      [[./img/gitlab-cc-by-nd-sa-4.0-wm_no_bg_prometheus.png]]
      - Based on underlying continuous integration infrastructure
        using [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] image
        [[./img/docker-tm-horizontal_small.png]]

** Build Presentations on Command Line
   1. Create Org file in directory ~emacs-reveal-howto/~
      - See contained source file for this presentation, ~howto.org~
   2. Build presentations for files ending in ~.org~ (except internal
      ones listed in ~elisp/publish.el~)
      - ~emacs --batch --load elisp/publish.el --funcall org-publish-all~
      - Presentations are built in subdirectory ~public/~
   3. Open presentation in [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/][Firefox]]
      - E.g.: ~firefox public/howto.html~
   4. Optional: Copy ~public/~ to web server for public accessibility

** Building Presentations in Emacs
   1. Generate HTML presentation for visited
      ~.org~ file using the usual Org export functionality: @@html:<br>@@
      Press ~C-c C-e R B~
      - This generates an HTML file in the same directory and opens it
	in your default browser
      - For this to work, necessary resources, in particular the
	~reveal.js~ directory, must be accessible in the ~.org~ file’s
	directory

** Build Presentations on GitLab
   1. Fork [[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal-howto][project]]
      on GitLab ([[https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/workflow/forking_workflow.html][fork documentation]])
      - (Instead of forking, maybe use ~git clone~ [[Installation][see above]];
        import that as new project on GitLab)
   2. Create project’s files locally
      - ~git clone <the URL of YOUR GitLab project>~
   3. Create or update Org files in cloned directory, add, commit, and
      push (see next slide)
   4. GitLab infrastructure picks up changes and publishes presentations as
      [[https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/][GitLab Pages]]
      - Takes some minutes
      - Go to Settings → Pages to see the Pages’ address

*** On Git
    - Install Git
      ([[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git][getting started]])
      - The [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2][Pro Git book]] is a great source in general
    - Short [[https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1][in-browser Git demo]]
      - Explains Git commands ~add~, ~commit~, ~push~, and more


* Some Presentation Features
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: features
  :END:

** Text Slide
   - A list
   - With a sub-list whose items appear
     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
     - This is /emphasized/
     - This is *bold*
     - This ~looks like code~
     - This is [[color:green][green]]
     - Nothing special

** Some Fragment Styles
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (gray-out shrink grow highlight-red)
   - Forget
   - Shrink
   - Grow
   - Very important

** On Sections
   # As explained in the Org manual, link targets can have different
   # forms.  The first link below points to #features, which has been
   # defined above as CUSTOM_ID.  The second link uses the section
   # header’s text as link target.
   - This slide is part of section [[#features][Some Presentation Features]]
     - We can link to slides, e.g., [[Text Slide][the previous slide]]
       - You can use the browser history to go back
     - Side note: Check source code to see two variants of link
       targets used on this slide
   # The following directive with “appear” lets the next thing
   # appear in its entirety; instead of each list item individually as
   # on the previous slide with “(appear)” in parentheses.
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
   - This slide can also be perceived as its own subsection
     - The [[#another-anchor][next slide]] is on a deeper level of nesting
   - (This list item appears simultaneously with previous bullet point)

*** Another Slide
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: another-anchor
    :END:
    - This slide is on a deeper level of nesting
    - This level of nesting is not shown in the table of contents in
      the slide’s bottom
    - By the way, the headings in the table of contents below are
      hyperlinks
      - And your browser remembers the history, back/forward buttons
        and shortcuts should work
      - Mousewheel and swiping work

** Two Columns: Pro/Con of emacs-reveal
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
   #+BEGIN_leftcol
   Pro
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Free/libre open source software
   - Device-independent presentations
     - Also mobile and offline
     - Generated from simple text format
       - Easy to learn
       - Collaboration with diff/merge/git
       - Separation of layout and content
   #+END_leftcol

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
   #+BEGIN_rightcol
   Con
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

   #+END_rightcol

     [[http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Tours/][Tours]]
     is licensed under a

** Appearing Items with Audio
   (Audios produced with
   [[https://github.com/marytts/marytts][MaryTTS]],
   converted to Ogg format with [[http://www.audacityteam.org/][Audacity]])

** Go for it!
