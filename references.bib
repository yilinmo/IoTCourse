abstract = {In this paper, we present two novel algorithms to realize a finite dimensional, linear time-invariant state-space model from input-output data. The algorithms have a number of common features. They are classified as one of the subspace model identification schemes, in that a major part of the identification problem consists of calculating specially structured subspaces of spaces defined by the input-output data. This structure is then exploited in the calculation of a realization. Another common feature is their algorithmic organization: an RQ factorization followed by a singular value decomposition and the solution of an overdetermined set (or sets) of equations. The schemes assume that the underlying system has an output-error structure and that a measurable input sequence is available. The latter characteristic indicates that both schemes are versions of the MIMO Output-Error State Space model identification (MOESP) approach. The first algorithm is denoted in particular as the (elementary MOESP scheme)...},

@article{Yuan2020,
abstract = {There has been a surge of interests in the security of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), yet it is commonly assumed that the adversary has a full knowledge of physical system models. This paper argues that such an unrealistic assumption can be relaxed: the adversary might still be able to identify the system model by passively observing the control input and sensory data. In such a setup, the attack with knowledge of input-output data can be categorized as a Known-Plaintext Attack. A necessary and sufficient condition has been provided, under which the adversary can uniquely obtain the knowledge of the underlying physical system. From the defender's perspective, a secure controller designâ€”which exhibits a low rank structureâ€”is proposed which renders the system unidentifiable to the adversary, while trading off the control system's performance. Finally, a numerical example has been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed secure controller design.},

@inproceedings{Park2019,
abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of constructing a robust stealthy attack that compromises uncertain cyber-physical systems having unstable zeros. We first interpret the (non-robust) conventional zero-dynamics attack based on Byrnes-Isidori normal form, and then present a new robust zero-dynamics attack for uncertain plants. Different from the conventional strategy, our key idea is to isolate the real zero-dynamics from the plant's input-output relation and to replace it with an auxiliary nominal zero-dynamics. As a result, this alternative attack does not require the exact model knowledge anymore. The price to pay for the robustness is to utilize the input and output signals of the system (i.e., disclosure resources). It is shown that a disturbance observer can be employed to realize the new attack philosophy when there is a lack of model knowledge. Simulation results with a hydro-turbine power system are presented to verify the attack performance and robustness.},

@article{Mo2011,
abstract = {It is often appealing to assume that existing solutions can be directly applied to emerging engineering domains. Unfortunately, careful investigation of the unique challenges presented by new domains exposes its idiosyncrasies, thus often requiring new approaches and solutions. In this paper, we argue that the "smart" grid, replacing its incredibly successful and reliable predecessor, poses a series of new security challenges, among others, that require novel approaches to the field of cyber security. We will call this new field cyber-physical security. The tight coupling between information and communication technologies and physical systems introduces new security concerns, requiring a rethinking of the commonly used objectives and methods. Existing security approaches are either inapplicable, not viable, insufficiently scalable, incompatible, or simply inadequate to address the challenges posed by highly complex environments such as the smart grid. A concerted effort by the entire industry, the research community, and the policy makers is required to achieve the vision of a secure smart grid infrastructure.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the detection and isolation of replay attacks on sensor measurements. As opposed to previously proposed additive watermarking, we propose a multiplicative watermarking scheme, where each sensor's output is separately watermarked by being fed to a SISO watermark generator. Additionally, a set of equalizing filters is placed at the controller's side, which reconstructs the original output signals from the received watermarked data. We show that the proposed scheme has several advantages over existing approaches: it has no detrimental effects on the closed-loop performance in the absence of attacks; it can be designed in a modular fashion, independently of the design of the controller and anomaly detector; it facilitates the detection of replay attacks and the isolation of the time at which the replayed data was recorded. These properties are discussed in detail and the results are illustrated through a numerical example.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of designing physical watermark signals in order to optimally detect possible replay attack in a linear time-invariant system, under the assumption that the system parameters are unknown and need to be identified online. We first provide a replay attack model, where an adversary replays the previous sensor data in order to fool the system. A physical watermarking scheme, which leverages a random control input as a watermark to detect the replay attack, is then introduced. The optimal watermark signal design problem is cast as an optimization problem, which aims to achieve the optimal trade-off between control performance and intrusion detection. An online watermarking design and system identification algorithm is provided to deal with systems with unknown parameters. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal one and characterize the almost sure convergence rate. A numerical example and an industrial process example are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

abstract = {The resilience of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for electric power networks for certain cyber-attacks is considered. We analyze the vulnerability of the measurement system to false data attack on communicated measurements. The vulnerability analysis problem is shown to be NP-hard, meaning that unless P=NP there is no polynomial time algorithm to analyze the vulnerability of the system. Nevertheless, we identify situations, such as the full measurement case, where the analysis problem can be solved efficiently. In such cases, we show indeed that the problem can be cast as a generalization of the minimum cut problem involving nodes with possibly nonzero costs. We further show that it can be reformulated as a standard minimum cut problem (without node costs) on a modified graph of proportional size. An important consequence of this result is that our approach provides the first exact efficient algorithm for the vulnerability analysis problem under the full measurement assumption. Furthermore, our approach also provides an efficient heuristic algorithm for the general NP-hard problem. Our results are illustrated by numerical studies on benchmark systems including the IEEE 118-bus system.},

abstract = {The vast majority of today's critical infrastructure is supported by numerous feedback control loops and an attack on these control loops can have disastrous consequences. This is a major concern since modern control systems are becoming large and decentralized and thus more vulnerable to attacks. This paper is concerned with the estimation and control of linear systems when some of the sensors or actuators are corrupted by an attacker. We give a new simple characterization of the maximum number of attacks that can be detected and corrected as a function of the pair (A,C) of the system and we show in particular that it is impossible to accurately reconstruct the state of a system if more than half the sensors are attacked. In addition, we show how the design of a secure local control loop can improve the resilience of the system. When the number of attacks is smaller than a threshold, we propose an efficient algorithm inspired from techniques in compressed sensing to estimate the state of the plant despite attacks. We give a theoretical characterization of the performance of this algorithm and we show on numerical simulations that the method is promising and allows to reconstruct the state accurately despite attacks. Finally, we consider the problem of designing output-feedback controllers that stabilize the system despite sensor attacks. We show that a principle of separation between estimation and control holds and that the design of resilient output feedback controllers can be reduced to the design of resilient state estimators.},

The sensory data collected by the compromised sensors can be manipulated arbitrarily by the attacker. The classical estimators, such as the least squares estimator, may not provide a reliable estimate under the so-called (p,m)-sparse attack. In this paper, we are not restricting our efforts to studying whether any specific estimator is resilient to the attack or not, but instead we aim to present some generic sufficient and necessary conditions for resilience by considering a general class of convex optimization based estimators. The sufficient and necessary conditions are shown to be tight, with a trivial gap. We further specialize our result to the scalar sensor measurements case and extend our framework to incorporate estimators with correlated cost function optimization.

abstract = {The optimal control of the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in buildings has a significant energy saving potential and therefore is of a great practical interest. An event-based HVAC control adjusts control actions when certain events occur, which may be faster and more scalable than state-based or time-driven control methods. However, events may capture either local or global changes in the rooms. The choice of events is a tradeoff between the computational efficiency and the control performance. This challenging problem remains open. We consider this as an important problem in this paper and make three major contributions. First, we define local and global events for the HVAC control problem. The complexity of these event-based control policies is defined. Second, based on hypothesis testing, we develop a method to select events that capture a sufficient state information and with a relatively small event space. Third, we demonstrate the performance of this method on two groups of examples, including one group of small-scale problems for the proof of concept and the other group of large-scale problems in the HVAC control. It is shown that our method outperforms the Levin search, which is a traditional complexity-based search method and finds event-based HVAC control policies with a good performance. Note to Practitioners - When there are multiple rooms in a building, the HVAC control may achieve a significant energy saving and an indoor comfort satisfaction in the same time through exploring the coupling among the rooms. By appropriately defining the events, the size of the event space is usually much smaller than the state space. Therefore, an event-based control is more scalable and preferred in practice. Local events capture the state changes of rooms in a small neighborhood, which leads to a small event space but limited information. Global events capture the state changes of rooms in a large neighborhood, which leads to more information but a large event space. It remains open how to select events in large-scale HVAC control problems, especially when the computing budget is limited. In this paper, we define the complexity of an event-based control policy by the number of neighboring rooms considered. We develop a method based on hypothesis testing to select events with a proper complexity in order to achieve a good system performance. The performance of this method is demonstrated on an HVAC control problem.},

abstract = {Recent research shows that 20{\%}-30{\%} of building energy consumption can be saved through optimized operation and management without changing the building structure and the hardware configuration of the energy supply system. Therefore, there is a huge potential for building energy savings through efficient operation. Microgrid technology provides an opportunity and a desirable infrastructure for improving the efficiency of energy consumption in buildings. The key to improve building energy efficiency in operation is to coordinate and optimize the operation of various energy sources and loads. In this paper, the scheduling problem of building energy supplies is considered with the practical background of a low energy building. The objective function is to minimize the overall cost of electricity and natural gas for a building operation over a time horizon while satisfying the energy balance and complicated operating constraints of individual energy supply equipment and devices. The uncertainties are captured and their impact is analyzed by the scenario tree method. Numerical testing is performed with the data of the pilot low energy building. The testing results show that significant energy cost savings can be achieved through integrated scheduling and control of various building energy supply sources. It is very important to fully utilize solar energy and optimize the operation of electrical storage. It is also shown that precooling is a simple way to achieve energy savings. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1963-2012 IEEE. Average consensus is a widely used algorithm for distributed computing and control, where all the agents in the network constantly communicate and update their states in order to achieve an agreement. This approach could result in an undesirable disclosure of information on the initial state of an agent to the other agents. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving average consensus algorithm to guarantee the privacy of the initial state and asymptotic consensus on the exact average of the initial values, by adding and subtracting random noises to the consensus process. We characterize the mean square convergence rate of our consensus algorithm and derive the covariance matrix of the maximum likelihood estimate on the initial state. Moreover, we prove that our proposed algorithm is optimal in the sense that it does not disclose any information more than necessary to achieve the average consensus. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.},

We assume that each sensor has a maximum duty cycle and at most one sensor can communicate with a remote estimator at each time step due to the limited communication bandwidth. When a sensor is scheduled to send data, it sends the most recent measurement data to the estimator. Upon receiving the measurement data from the sensors, the estimator computes the optimal estimate of the state of the process. We first present a necessary condition for a periodic sensor schedule to be optimal. Based on this necessary condition, we construct an optimal periodic schedule that minimizes the estimation error at the estimator and at the same time satisfies the energy and communication bandwidth constraints.

In this paper, we show that, unlike many other cases such as intermittent observations or TCP-like systems, the system state follows a Gaussian mixture distribution with exponentially increasing terms, which leads to a Gaussian sum filter-based optimal estimation. We develop an auxiliary estimator method to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the mean estimation error covariance matrices. It is revealed that the stability is independent of the packet loss rate, and is not affected by the lack of acknowledgment.

At each time step, a node is selected to interact with one of its neighbors via deterministic or random gossiping. The selected node generates a random number to replace its current state, and sends to the neighbor the difference between the current state and the random number. On receiving the data from the selected node, the neighbor sets its new state as the sum of its current state and the difference.

abstract = {Collaborative computing uses multiple data servers to jointly complete data analysis, e.g., statistical analysis and inference. One major obstruction for it lies in privacy concern, which is directly associated with nodes' participation and the fidelity of received data. Existing privacy-preserving paradigms for cloud computing and distributed data aggregation only provide nodes with homogeneous privacy protection without consideration of nodes' diverse trust degrees to different data servers. We propose a two-phase framework that computes the average value while preserving heterogeneous privacy for nodes' private data. The new challenge is that in the premise of meeting privacy requirements, we should guarantee the proposed framework has the same computation accuracy with existing privacy-aware solutions. In this paper, nodes obtain heterogeneous privacy protection in the face of different data servers through one-shot noise perturbation. Based on the definition of KL privacy, we derive the analytical expressions of the privacy preserving degrees (PPDs) and quantify the relation between different PPDs. Then, we obtain the closed-form expression of computation accuracy. Furthermore, an efficient incentive mechanism is proposed to achieve optimized computation accuracy when data servers have fixed budgets. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the obtained theoretical results.},

abstract = {This paper considers control and estimation problems where the sensor signals and the actuator signals are transmitted to various subsystems over a network. In contrast to traditional control and estimation problems, here the observation and control packets may be lost or delayed. The unreliability of the underlying communication network is modeled stochastically by assigning probabilities to the successful transmission of packets. This requires a novel theory which generalizes classical control/estimation paradigms. The paper offers the foundations of such a novel theory. The central contribution is to characterize the impact of the network reliability on the performance of the feedback loop. Specifically, it is shown that for network protocols where successful transmissions of packets is acknowledged at the receiver (e.g., TCP-like protocols), there exists a critical threshold of network reliability (i.e., critical probabilities for the successful delivery of packets), below which the optimal controller fails to stabilize the system. Further, for these protocols, the separation principle holds and the optimal LQG controller is a linear function of the estimated state. In stark contrast, it is shown that when there is no acknowledgement of successful delivery of control packets (e.g., UDP-like protocols), the LQG optimal controller is in general nonlinear. Consequently, the separation principle does not hold in this circumstance {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},
