    {{{revealimg("./figures/osimodel.meta",t,"60vh")}}}

*** Data-Link Layer
- Physical Layer: handles transmission of raw bits
- What is not taken care of...
  - Handling collision
  - Multiplexing
  - Error checking
  - Framing

*** Data-Link Layer

- Logical Link Control (LLC)
  - IEEE 802.2 standard
  - recognizing where frames begin and end in the bit-stream
  - (de)multiplexing different protocols to be transmitted over the MAC layer
  - optionally providing flow control, and detection and retransmission of dropped frames
    - Usually provided by transport layer protocols (TCP) in an end-to-end fashion
- Medium/Media Access Control (MAC)

*** What is MAC?

- Defines how a node obtains a channel when it needs to
  - Determines who gets to send data at any given time
  - Avoid Collision

*** Design Considerations

- What kind of a resource do we have?
  - Frequency: bandwidth
  - Time: Latency
  - Energy
- How much does a node need?
  - How often?
  - How regular? Is the communication bursty or not?
- What kind of a "guarantee" should be provided?
- Do we need central control or "let things happen as they may"?
- Complexity/Fairness/...

** The Collision Problem in Wireless Communications

- Two nodes send to the same node at the same time
- Interference of data: data loss

*** Ethernet vs. Wireless

- Ethernet
  - Medium is clear
    - if you sense no carrier, there is no one sending data on the wire
  - Node can send and receive at the same time
- Wireless LAN
  - Medium is not clear
      - possible that some node is sending data but is out of your range
  - Cannot send and receive at the same time
      - (assuming a single frequency)

*** The "Hidden Terminal" Problem
- Station C is sending data to station B. 
- Station A wants to do the same and listens for other frames being sent. 
- Since A is *out of the range* of station C, it does *NOT* notice its frames and thinks the media is free. 
- A and C transmit simultaneously to B, and B loses *both* frames.

    {{{revealimg("./figures/hiddennode.meta",t,"40vh")}}}

*** The "Exposed Terminal" Problem

- The two transmitters (S1, S2) in the middle are in range of each other. 
- The two receivers (R1, R2) are out of range of each other
- If a transmission between S1 and R1 is taking place:
  - However, S2 can "hear" S1’s transmission
  - S2 concludes that it will interfere with  S1
  - So S2 chooses *NOT* to transmit
- However R1 cannot hear S2 and R2 cannot hear S1.

  {{{revealimg("./figures/exposednode.meta",t,"40vh")}}}

*** Wasted Energy in Communication

- Collisions
  - Data become corrupted
  - Expend more energy for re-transmission
- Overhearing
  - Receiving a frame intended for another node
  - Expend energy receiving a frame that is useless
- Control Packet Overhead
  - Large overhead translates into sending larger packets or more packets, and therefore more energy expended
- Idle Listening
  - Waiting to receive a frame
  - Receiver expends energy and receives no data
  - #1 source of wasted energy

*** Collision Problem (Wireless Version)

- Collision cannot be sensed when transmitting
- Hidden Terminal problem
- Exposed Terminal problem
- Energy concern 

** Types of MAC

- Ordered Access
- Deterministic Access
  - Some of the protocols are in the physical layer
- Random Access
- Hybrid

* Ordered Access

** Ordered Access

- Not random
- Not controlled by a central control point that allocates channels
- Token Ring 
  - Introduced by IBM in 1984
  - Standardized in 1989 as IEEE 802.5
  - Was successful in corporate environments 
  - Taken over by Ethernet (Random Access)

*** Token Passing

- Only the system which has some "token" can communicate {{{reveallicense("./figures/ibmmau.meta","20vh")}}}
- Token is passed to the next candidate in a sequential manner
  {{{revealimg("./figures/tokenring.meta",t,"50vh")}}}


*** Problems with Ordered Access

- How about in a wireless network?
  - Nodes might leave?
  - Break the Order
  - Take away the token

* Deterministic Access
** Deterministic Access
- Controlled by a central control point that allocates channels
  - Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
  - Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)
  - Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA)
  - Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
- Requires access points for coordination

** Frequency Division & Time Division 

- Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
  - Two distinct frequencies at the same time for the two directions
  - Capacity is determined by frequency band allocation, making it difficult to make a dynamic change.
- Time Division Duplexing (TDD)
  - Two distinct sets of time slots on the same frequency for the two directions
  - Cheaper since without the need of a diplexer to isolate transmission and receptions.
  - Possible to change the uplink and downlink capacity ratio dynamically according to the needs.
  - Time latency because only half-duplex
  - Guard period is necessary
- Both are used in 4G (not compatible)
  - China Unicom, Telecom: FDD
  - China Mobile: TDD -> FDD

*** Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)

- Multiple users share the same frequency band via cyclically repeating "time slots"
  - particular time slot re-occurring every frame of N slots
  - Transmission for any user is non-continuous: buffer-and-burst digital data & modulation needed, lower battery consumption
  - Larger overhead: synchronization bits for each data burst, guard bits for variations in propagation delay and delay spread

*** Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)

- Assign different frequency bands to individual users
  - Available spectrum is divided into a number of “narrowband” channels
  - Frequency band assigned to users who request service

*** LTE Resource Block cite:Lea2018
  {{{revealimg("./figures/lteresouceblock.meta","LTE Resource Block","40vh",nil,'none)}}}

*** LTE Resource Block
- Each LTE frame is 10ms and 20MHz, 2MHz of which are used as guard band.
- A resource block of 180kHz and 0.5ms can be allocated to each user.
- \( (20-2)/0.18 \times 10/0.5 = 2000 \) resource blocks in 1 frame.
- Each resource block is further divided into \(12\times 15Khz \) subcarriers.
- 7 OFDM symbols can be transmitted by 1 subcarrier in one block (\(0.5 ms \times 15kHz\))
- 1 resource block can transmit 84 OFDM symbols
- \(84\times 2000 = 168k\) OFDM symbols can be transmitted in 1 frame 
- The symbol rate is 16.8M/s
- Assuming 16-QAM, the raw bit rate is \(16.8\times \log_216 = 67.2Mbps\).
** Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
- Exploits mathematical properties of orthogonality



** Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA)
- Traditional mobile network has no information on the position of the mobile units 
  - Hence, the signal is transmitted in all directions 
  - Likewise, in reception, the antenna receives signals coming from all directions 
    - including interference signals.
- For SDMA, the antenna, both in transmission and reception, is adapted to each user to obtain highest gain in the direction of that user.
  - This is often done using phased array techniques.
* Contention-Based

** Random Access

- Randomly access media, usually detect collision *after* it happens
  - ALOHA
  - Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
  - Carrier Sense Multiple Access w/ Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
  - Carrier Sense Multiple Access w/ Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)

** ALOHA 

*** Slotted ALOHA
- Time is divided into "slots" of one frame duration
  - E.g., fixed size frames
- When a node has a frame to send, it waits until the start of the next slot to send it 
  - *Requires synchronization*
- If no other nodes attempt transmission during that slot, the transmission is successful
  - Otherwise "collision" 
  - Collided frames are re-transmitted after a random delay
- Simple and has low latency under low traffic
- But not efficient under high traffic

*** Throughput of Slotted ALOHA 
- Assuming that the packet transmission attempts in a time slot follows a Poission distribution of rate \(\lambda\)
 - Valid when there are many nodes, each transmit independently with a small probability
\(P(\#attempts) = \frac{\lambda^k}{k^!}\exp(-\lambda).\)
- The probability of idle: \(\exp(-\lambda)\).
- The probability of successful transmission: \(\lambda\exp(-\lambda)\).
- The probability of collision: \(1-\exp(\lambda)-\lambda\exp(-\lambda)\).
- Maximum throughput is \(1/e\approx 0.368\), when \(\lambda = 1\).

*** Throughput of Slotted ALOHA

*** Pure ALOHA
- A node can transmit as soon as it has a frame to send
- Each node acts independently
- No need for synchronization
- Smaller delay than slotted version when traffic is low
- More chance for interference

*** Pure v.s. Slotted ALOHA
- Slotted: Collision can only occur if someone else transmitted at time \(k\)
- Pure: Collision can occur if someone else transmitted between time \(k-1,k+1\)
  - The probability of a successful transmission is \(\lambda \exp(-2\lambda)\)
  - Maximum throughput is \(1/2e\approx 0.184\), when \(\lambda = 0.5\).

** Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)

- Verifies the absence of other traffic before transmitting
- If a carrier is sensed, the node waits for the transmission in progress to finish before initiating its own transmission.
- However, if two nodes try to send a frame at nearly the same time, neither detects a carrier so both begin transmitting.

** Carrier Sense Multiple Access w/ Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)

- Sending nodes are able to detect when a collision occurs and stop transmitting immediately, backing off for a random amount of time before trying again
- Used in Ethernet
- Does not work in Wireless
  - hidden node problem
  - cannot send and receive at the same time

** Carrier Sense Multiple Access w/ Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)

- IEEE 802.11 Standard
- First, listen to the channel for a pre-determined amount of time so as to check for any activity on the channel
- If the channel is sensed “idle”, then the station is permitted to transmit
- If the channel is sensed as "busy" the station has to delay its next carrier sense for a *random* amount of time
  - Ethernet will continuously listen to the channel and transmit *immediately* after the channel is clear for 96bit time
- Additional RTS/CTS mechanism can also be used 

*** CSMA/CA

    {{{revealimg("./figures/csmaca.meta",t,"60vh")}}}
*** Hidden Terminal Problem

- Partially solves the hidden node problem
- T will get to know about the activity of H from CTS packet of R
- RTS packet is small (low cost of collision)

todo

*** Exposed Terminal Problem
    
** Design Considerations

*** Random Access
- Carrier sense or not?
  - What is the probability of "hearing someone is talking"?
- Slotted or Unslotted?
- Cost of collision v.s. cost of overhead?

*** Deterministic v.s. Random

#+BEGIN_leftcol
- Deterministic Access
  - High throughput when traffic is heavy
  - Small delay variance
  - Large delay when traffic is low
  - Relatively larger overhead of processing
#+END_leftcol
#+BEGIN_rightcol
- Random Access
  - Small overhead of processing
  - Small delay when the traffic is low
  - Too many collisions when traffic is heavy
    - Throughput decreases with load
  - May subject to large delays
#+END_rightcol

* Hybrid MAC: IEEE 802.15.4


** IEEE 802.15.4 Protocol Revisit

- Low-rate Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)
- For wireless sensor networks, home automation, home networking, connecting devices to a PC, home security, etc.
- Combines schedule-based and contention-based schemes
- Different roles as different types of nodes

*** Node Type and Topology

- There are two types of nodes in 802.15.4:
|                              | Roles                               |
| Full Function Device (FFD)   | PAN Coordinator, Coordinator,Device |
| Reduced Function Device(RFD) | Device                              |
- Device must be connected to a coordinator/PAN coordinator and form a star topology
- Coordinator:
  - can communicate with the devices connected to it
  - or other coordinators (in a peer-to-peer) fashion
  - It can also relay messages from/to its devices
- In addition, one of the coordinators is designated as a PAN coordinator: 
  - has the duty of transmitting network beacons and storing node information
  - the PAN coordinator is constantly receiving transmissions and is usually on a dedicated power line
  - also serves as the gateway to LAN/WAN

*** IEEE 802.15.4 Topology

todo

** Medium Access Control for IEEE 802.15.4

*** Beacon Mode 

- PAN coordinator communication
  - Super-frame structure
    - 16 time slots
    - up to 7 time slots in the end of the super-frame can be guaranteed time slots
  - Inactive nodes including coordinator switch off their transceivers
- Data transfer with guaranteed time-slot
  - Device gets guaranteed time slots only if it sends request frames during contention access period
  - Device transmits immediately in time slot without carrier sense or collision avoiding
- Data transfer without guaranteed time-slot
  - Slotted CSMA-CA

*** Beacon mode
    
todo

*** Beaconless mode

- PAN coordinator does not send beacon frames
- No guaranteed time-slot
- Un-slotted (not time-synchronized) CSMA-CA
- PAN coordinator must be "on" constantly, although devices can follow their own sleep schedule
