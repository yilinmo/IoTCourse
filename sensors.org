* Energy management

- Active sensor power
- Frequency of data collection
- Wireless radio communication strength and power
- Frequency of communication
- Microprocessor or microcontroller power as a function of core frequency
- Passive component power
- Energy loss from leakage or power supply inefficiency
- Power reserve for actuators and motors
 
For example, the TI SensorTag C2650 has the following power characteristics:
- Standby mode: 0.24 mA
- Running with all sensors disabled: 0.33 mA
- LEDs
- All sensors on at 100 ms/sample data rate and broadcasting BLE: 5.5 mA:
  - Temperature sensor: 0.84 mA
  - Light sensor: 0.56 mA
  - Accelerometer and gyros: 4.68 mA
  - Barometric sensor: 0.5 mA
The TI SensorTag uses a standard CR2032 coin cell battery rated at 240 mAh. Therefore, the maximum life is expected to be about 44 hours.

Many power management practices are employed, such as
- New material: clock gating components not being used in silicon
- reducing the clock rates of processors or microcontrollers
- adjusting the sensing frequency and broadcast frequency
- back-off strategies to reduce communication strength
- and various levels of sleep modes.
 These techniques are widely used in the computing business as a general practice.
