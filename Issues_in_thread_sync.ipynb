A race condition may be defined as the occurring of a condition when two or more threads can access shared data and then try to change its value at the same time. Due to this, the values of variables may be unpredictable and vary depending on the timings of context switches of the processes."

    "Deadlock is a troublesome issue one can face while designing the concurrent systems. We can illustrate this issue with the help of the dining philosopher problem as follows −\n",
    "\n",
    "Edsger Dijkstra originally introduced the dining philosopher problem, one of the famous illustrations of one of the biggest problem of concurrent system called deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, there are five famous philosophers sitting at a round table eating some food from their bowls. There are five forks that can be used by the five philosophers to eat their food. However, the philosophers decide to use two forks at the same time to eat their food.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there are two main conditions for the philosophers. First, each of the philosophers can be either in eating or in thinking state and second, they must first obtain both the forks, i.e., left and right. The issue arises when each of the five philosophers manages to pick the left fork at the same time. Now they all are waiting for the right fork to be free but they will never relinquish their fork until they have eaten their food and the right fork would never be available. Hence, there would be a deadlock state at the dinner table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deadlock in concurrent system\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we see, the same issue can arise in our concurrent systems too. The forks in the above example would be the system resources and each philosopher can represent the process, which is competing to get the resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution with Python program\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution of this problem can be found by splitting the philosophers into two types – **greedy philosophers** and **generous philosophers**. Mainly a greedy philosopher will try to pick up the left fork and wait until it is there. He will then wait for the right fork to be there, pick it up, eat and then put it down. On the other hand, a generous philosopher will try to pick up the left fork and if it is not there, he will wait and try again after some time. If they get the left fork then they will try to get the right one. If they will get the right fork too then they will eat and release both the forks. However, if they will not get the right fork then they will release the left fork."
