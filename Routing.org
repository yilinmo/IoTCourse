* Overview

** OSI 7-Layer Network Model

   {{{revealimg("./figures/osimodel.meta",t,"40vh")}}}
- The network layer is responsible for packet forwarding 
  - routing the packets through intermediate routers

** Types of Routing Protocols


* Flooding and Gossiping
** Flooding
- Incoming packet is sent through *every* outgoing link except the one it arrived on. 
- How to deal graph containing cycles?
  - TTL (time to live)
  - Only forward packets that are not seen before
    - need to cache historic packets
** Gossiping
- Incoming packet is sent to *random* outgoing link with certain probability
- The system behaves as a Markov Chain

** Controlled Flooding
- Combining gossiping and flooding
* Active Routing
* Passive Routing
