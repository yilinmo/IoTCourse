** Internet of Things
   /Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as "connected devices" and "smart devices"), buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data./

*** Early History of Internet of Things
    - 1973: Mario W. Cardullo receives the patent for first RFID tag
    - 1982 Carnegie Mellon internet-connected soda machine
    - 1991: HP introduces HP LaserJet IIISi: first Ethernet-connected network printer
    - 1993: Internet-connected coffee pot at University of Cambridge (first internet-connected camera)
    - 1999: LG Internet Digital DIOS refrigerator
    - 1999: The term [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things][Internet of Things]] was coined
    - 2005: United Nation's International Telecommunications Union report predicting the rise of IoT for the first time

*** Trends

   \[V \propto N^2]
   
** Cyber-Physical Systems
   {{{revealimg("figures/cps.meta","Cyber-Physical System","40vh",nil,'none)}}}
   /CPSs refer to the next generation of engineered systems that require tight integration of *computing*, *communication*, and *control* technologies to achieve *stability*, *performance*, *reliability*, *robustness*, and *efficiency* in dealing with physical systems of many application domains./

*** Convergence of Computation and Control 

    - 1948: The term "Cybernetics" was coined by Norbert Wiener.
    - 1970s: Real time system
    - 1990s: Hybrid system
    - 2006: The term "Cyber-Physical System" was coined by NSF.

*** Boeing 787 Incident 
    
*** Convergence of Communication and Control
    - 1971: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALOHAnet][ALOHAnet]], first public wireless packet data network
    - 1997: IEEE 802.11 (Wifi) was introduced
    - 2000: Panel on Future Directions in Control, Dynamics, and Systems, Control in an Information Rich World:
    /Networks of sensory or actuator nodes with computational capabilities, connected wirelessly or by wires, can form an orchestra which controls our physical environment./

*** Convergence of Communication and Computation
    - distributed systems
    - cognitive radio
