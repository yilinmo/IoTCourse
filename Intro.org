#+DESCRIPTION: 

* History of Intelligent Network System
 
** Wireless Sensor Networks
   
- 1997: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartdust][Smart Dust Project]] proposed by researchers from UCB
 
** Internet of Things
/In the real world, things matter more than ideas./

 /Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as "connected devices" and "smart devices"), buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data./

*** History of "Things"
    
*** History of Internet of Things    

*** Trends
- Google Search Trends
- The Hype Cycle
- Number of Connected Devices v.s. Human Population
- Metcalfe's law
    
** Cyber-Physical Systems
  {{{revealimg("./cps.meta","Cyber-Physical System","40vh",nil,'none)}}}
 /CPSs refer to the next generation of engineered systems that require tight integration of *computing*, *communication*, and *control* technologies to achieve *stability*, *performance*, *reliability*, *robustness*, and *efficiency* in dealing with physical systems of many application domains./

*** Convergence of Computation and Control 

- 1948: The term "Cybernetics" was coined by Norbert Wiener.
- 1970s: Real time system
- 1990s: Hybrid system
- 2006: The term "Cyber-Physical System" was coined by NSF.

*** Boeing 787 Incident 
    
*** Convergence of Communication and Control
- 1971: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALOHAnet][ALOHAnet]], first public wireless packet data network
- 1997: IEEE 802.11 (Wifi) was introduced
- 1999: The term [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things][Internet of Things]] was invented.
- 2000: Panel on Future Directions in Control, Dynamics, and Systems, Control in an Information Rich World:
/Networks of sensory or actuator nodes with computational capabilities, connected wirelessly or by wires, can form an orchestra which controls our physical environment./

*** Convergence of Communication and Computation
- distributed systems
- cognitive radio

*** Many-Sidedness of Internet of Things & CPS

- Increasing productivity (machine learning and data analytics)
- Cannibalization (Nest replacing traditional thermostats)

** Manufacturing  
** Consumer 
** Retail
** Healthcare
** Energy
** Transportation
** Smart City
