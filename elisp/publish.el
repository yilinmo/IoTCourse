;;; Commentary:
;; Publication of Org source files to reveal.js uses Org export
;; functionality offered by org-re-reveal and oer-reveal.
;; Initialization code for both is provided by emacs-reveal.
;; Note that org-re-reveal and oer-reveal are available on MELPA.
;;
;; Use this file from its parent directory with the following shell
;; command:
;; emacs --batch --load elisp/publish.el

;;; Code:
(package-initialize)
(require 'oer-reveal)

;; Setup dot.
;; The following supposes that png images are generated into directory img,
;; which needs to exist.
(make-directory "img" t)
(setq oer-reveal-publish-babel-languages '((dot . t) (emacs-lisp . t))
      org-publish-project-alist
      (list (list "img"
                  :base-directory "img"
                  :base-extension "png"
                  :publishing-function 'org-publish-attachment
                  :publishing-directory "./public/img")))
