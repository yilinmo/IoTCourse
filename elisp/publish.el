;;; Commentary:
;; Publication of Org source files to reveal.js uses Org export
;; functionality offered by emacs-reveal, which bundles reveal.js with
;; several plugins and MELPA packages org-re-reveal,
;; org-re-reveal-ref, and oer-reveal.  Initialization code is provided
;; by emacs-reveal.
;;
;; Use this file from its parent directory with the following shell
;; command:
;; emacs --batch --load elisp/publish.el

;;; Code:
;; Setup dot.
;; The following supposes that png images are generated into directory img,
;; which needs to exist.
(make-directory "img" t)
(setq oer-reveal-publish-babel-languages '((dot . t) (emacs-lisp . t))
