;;; Commentary:
;; Publication of Org source files to reveal.js uses Org export
;; functionality offered by org-re-reveal and oer-reveal.
;; Initialization code for both is provided by emacs-reveal.
;; Note that org-re-reveal and oer-reveal are available on MELPA.
;;
;; Use this file from its parent directory with the following shell
;; command:
;; emacs --batch --load elisp/publish.el

;;; Code:
(package-initialize)
(require 'oer-reveal)

;; Load emacs-reveal.
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/elpa/emacs-reveal"))
(condition-case nil
    ;; Either require package with above hard-coded location
    ;; (e.g., in docker) ...
    (require 'emacs-reveal)
  (error
   ;; ... or look for sub-directory "emacs-reveal" of parent project.
   (add-to-list
