;;; Commentary:
;; Publication of Org source files to reveal.js uses Org export
;; functionality offered by org-re-reveal and oer-reveal.
;; Initialization code for both is provided by emacs-reveal.
;; Note that org-re-reveal and oer-reveal are available on MELPA.
;;
;; Use this file from its parent directory with the following shell
;; command:
;; emacs --batch --load elisp/publish.el

;;; Code:
(package-initialize)
(setq
 oer-reveal-plugins
 '("reveal.js-plugins" "Reveal.js-TOC-Progress" "reveal.js-jump-plugin"
   "reveal.js-quiz" "reveal.js-coursemod" "klipse-libs"))

;; Uncomment the following for tests with unreleased changes.
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "../oer-reveal")
;; (require 'oer-reveal)
;; (require 'oer-reveal-publish)

;; Setup dot.
;; The following supposes that png images are generated into directory img,
;; which needs to exist.
