* Overview

** OSI Physical Layer
- Concerned with the transmission of unstructured
bit streams over the physical medium
- Deals with accessing the physical medium
  - Mechanical characteristics
  - Electrical characteristics
  - Functional characteristics
  - Procedural characteristics

* Modulation and Demodulation
 
** Frequency Band
  
* AWGN Channels
** Impairments
- Free space loss
- Noise
- Atmospheric absorption
- Fading
  - Multi-path
  - Small-scale fading

** Free Space Loss
   
** Noise
- Thermal Noise
  - Noise seen in switching circuits due to electrons
  - Function of temperature
   \[N = kTB\]
  - \(N\): Noise, \(k\): Boltzman constant, \(T\): Temperature, \(B\): Bandwidth
- Inter-modulation noise
  - Noise caused by signals at different frequencies on the same medium
- Crosstalk
  - coupling between signal paths
- Impulse Noise
  - Power spike (e.g. from thunder)

** Fundamental Limit

* Fading Channels and Diversity
 
** Multi-path
• Multi-path: obstacles reflect signals so that
multiple copies with varying delays are received
– Reflection - occurs when signal encounters a surface
that is large relative to the wavelength of the signal
– Diffraction - occurs at the edge of an impenetrable
body that is large compared to wavelength of radio
wave
– Scattering – occurs when incoming signal hits an
object whose size in the order of the wavelength of
the signal or less
*** Effects of Multi-path
– Multiple copies of a signal may arrive at different
phases
• If phases add destructively, the signal level relative to noise
declines, making signal detection more difficult
– Inter-symbol interference (ISI)
• One or more delayed copies of a pulse may arrive at the
same time as the primary pulse for a subsequent bit

 
** CDMA
** OFDM
