* Overview

** OSI 7-Layer Network Model

    {{{revealimg("./figures/osimodel.meta",t,"60vh")}}}

** OSI Physical Layer
- The physical layer defines the means of transmitting raw bits over a physical data link connecting network nodes. 
- Deals with accessing the physical medium
  - Mechanical characteristics
  - Electrical characteristics
  - Functional characteristics
  - Procedural characteristics
    
** Wireless PHY protocols
  {{{revealimg("./figures/wirelesscommunication.meta","Various wireless communication protocols and categories designed for different ranges\, data rates\, and use cases","60vh",nil,'none)}}}
   
** Electromagnetic Spectrum
 
    {{{revealimg("./figures/emspectrum.meta",t,"60vh")}}}
 
** Radio Frequency (RF) Signal
 
    {{{revealimg("./figures/ituradioband.meta",t,"60vh")}}}
    
** RF Band Allocation

    {{{revealimg("./figures/usfreqallocation.meta",t,"60vh")}}}

- Frequency band is a very *rare* & *important* resource!
   
** ISM Band
  
- Radio spectrum reserved internationally for industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) purposes 
  - e.g., microwave ovens
- Fastest-growing use for low power wireless communications systems
  - e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa
- Communications equipment must tolerate interference generated by ISM applications

| 902~928 MHz       | 915 MHz          | 26 MHz    | Region 2     |
| 2.4~2.5 GHz       | 2.45 GHz         | 100 MHz   | Worldwide    |
| 5.725~5.875 GHz   | 5.8 GHz          | 150 MHz   | Worldwide    |

* Digital Modulation and Demodulation

** Modulation Overview
- Modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the *carrier signal*, with a *modulating signal* that typically contains information to be transmitted. 
- In digital modulation, an *analog carrier signal* is modulated by a *discrete signal*.
- The most fundamental digital modulation techniques are based on keying:
  - ASK (amplitude-shift keying): a finite number of amplitudes are used.
  - FSK (frequency-shift keying): a finite number of frequencies are used.
  - PSK (phase-shift keying): a finite number of phases are used.
  - QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation): a finite number of at least two phases and at least two amplitudes are used.

*** Impairments

  - Multi-path (Next Section)
- Atmospheric absorption

*** Friis Transmission Equation
 
** Noise
- Thermal Noise(John-Nyquist Noise)
  - Noise seen in switching circuits due to electrons
- Inter-modulation noise
  - Noise caused by signals at different frequencies on the same medium
- Crosstalk
  - coupling between signal paths
- Impulse Noise
  - Power spike (e.g. from thunder)

*** Thermal Noise


- White noise since it contains the same level of power at all frequencies
 \[N = ktB\]
- \(k\) is the Boltzmann’s constant: \(1.381\times 10^{-21} W/(K\cdot Hz)\),
- \(T\) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and
- \(B\) is the bandwidth.
- At room temperature, \(T = 290K\), the thermal noise power spectral density
  \(kT =  –174 dBm/Hz\)

*** Multi-path
- Multi-path: obstacles reflect signals so that multiple copies with varying delays are received
  - Reflection - occurs when signal encounters a surface that is large relative to the wavelength of the signal
  - Diffraction - occurs at the edge of an impenetrable body that is large compared to wavelength of radio wave
  - Scattering – occurs when incoming signal hits an object whose size in the order of the wavelength of the signal or less
